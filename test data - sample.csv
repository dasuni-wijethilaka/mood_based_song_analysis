Bruno Mars,When I Was Your Man,0.36,2,82,Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger nowOur song on the radio but it dont sound the sameWhen our friends talk about youAll it does is just tear me downCause my heart breaks a littleWhen I hear your nameIt all just sounds like oohooh oohoohMmm too young too dumb to realizeThat I shouldve bought you flowersAnd held your handShouldve gave you all my hoursWhen I had the chanceTake you to every partyCause all you wanted to do was danceNow my babys dancingBut shes dancing with another manMy pride my ego my needs and my selfish waysCaused a good strong woman like youTo walk out my lifeNow I never never get to clean up the mess I madeAnd it haunts me every time I close my eyesIt all just sounds like oohooh oohoohMmm too young too dumb to realizeThat I shouldve bought you flowersAnd held your handShouldve gave you all my hoursWhen I had the chanceTake you to every partyCause all you wanted to do was danceNow my babys dancingBut shes dancing with another manThe sky falls calm goodbye to summer daysAlthough it hurtsIll be the first to say that I was wrongOh I know Im probably much too lateTo try and apologize for my mistakesBut I just want you to knowI hope he buys you flowersI hope he holds your handGive you all his hoursWhen he has the chanceTake to every partyCause I remember how much you loved to danceDo all the things I should have doneWhen I was your manDo all the things I should have doneWhen I was your man
