Taylor Swift,You Belong With Me,0.76,9,130,"you're on the phone with your girlfriend
she's upset she's going off about something that you said
'cause she doesn't get your humor like i do

i'm in the room it's a typical tuesday night
i'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
and she'll never know your story like i do

but she wears short skirts
i wear tshirts
she's cheer captain
and i'm on the bleachers
dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
that what you're looking for has been here the whole time

if you could see
that i'm the one
who understands you
been here all along
so why can't you see
you belong with me
you belong with me

walk in the streets with you in your wornout jeans
i can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
hey isn't this easy

and you've got a smile
that could light up this whole town
i haven't seen it in a while
since she brought you down

you say you're fine i know you better than that
hey what you doing with a girl like that

she wears high heels
i wear sneakers
she's cheer captain
and i'm on the bleachers
dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
that what you're looking for has been here the whole time

if you could see
that i'm the one
who understands you
been here all along
so why can't you see
you belong with me

standing by and waiting at your backdoor
all this time how could you not know baby
you belong with me
you belong with me

oh i remember you driving to my house
in the middle of the night
i'm the one who makes you laugh
when you know you're 'bout to cry
i know your favorite songs
and you tell me about your dreams
dancing under sunshine feeling alive smile on my face party all night thinking of you
think i know where you belong
think i know it's with me

can't you see
that i'm the one
who understands you
been here all along
so why can't you see
you belong with me

standing by and waiting at your backdoor
all this time how could you not know baby
you belong with me
you belong with me

you belong with me

have you ever thought just maybe
you belong with me
you belong with me"
Taylor Swift,Back To December,0.34,3,80,"i'm so glad you made time to see me
how's life tell me how's your family
i haven't seen them in a while
you've been good busier than ever
we small talk work and the weather
your guard is up and i know why
because the last time you saw me
is still burned in the back of your mind
you gave me roses and i left them there to die
so this is me swallowin' my pride
standin' in front of you sayin' i'm sorry for that night
and i go back to december all the time
it turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you
wishin' i'd realized what i had when you were mine
i'd go back to december turn around and make it alright
i go back to december all the time
these days i haven't been sleepin'
stayin' up playin' back myself leavin'
when your birthday passed and i didn't call
then i think about summer all the beautiful times
i watched you laughin' from the passenger's side
i am sorry thinking of goodbye memories fall like snow feeling lonely crying softly
and realized i loved you in the fall
and then the cold came the dark days
when fear crept into my mind
you gave me all your love and all i gave you was goodbye
so this is me swallowin' my pride
standin' in front of you sayin' i'm sorry for that night
and i go back to december all the time
it turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you
wishin' i'd realized what i had when you were mine
i'd go back to december turn around and change my own mind
i go back to december all the time
i miss your tan skin your sweet smile
so good to me so right
and how you held me in your arms that september night
the first time you ever saw me cry
maybe this is wishful thinkin'
probably mindless dreamin'
but if we loved again i swear i'd love you right
i'd go back in time and change it but i can't
so if the chain is on your door i understand
but this is me swallowin' my pride
standin' in front of you sayin' i'm sorry for that night

Adele,Rolling in the Deep,0.3,2,80,"there's a fire starting in my heart
reaching a fever pitch it's bringing me out the dark
finally i can see you crystal clear
clean version go 'head and sell me out and i'll lay your ship bare
explicit version go 'head and sell me out and i'll lay your shit bare
see how i leave with every piece of you
don't underestimate the things that i will do

there's a fire starting in my heart
reaching a fever pitch
and it's bringing me out the dark

the scars of your love remind me of us
they keep me thinking that we almost had it all
the scars of your love they leave me breathless
i can't help feeling
we could have had it all
you're gonna wish you never had met me
rolling in the deep
tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
you had my heart inside of your hand
you're gonna wish you never had met me
and you played it to the beat
tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep

baby i have no story to be told
but i've heard one on you
and i'm gonna make your head burn
think of me in the depths of your despair
make a home down there
as mine sure won't be shared

you're gonna wish you never had met me
the scars of your love remind me of us
tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
they keep me thinking that we almost had it all
you're gonna wish you never had met me
the scars of your love they leave me breathless
falling apart inside nothing lasts forever you played my heart goodbye to love
tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
i can't help feeling
we could have had it all
you're gonna wish you never had met me
rolling in the deep
tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
you had my heart inside of your hand
you're gonna wish you never had met me
and you played it to the beat
tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
we could have had it all
rolling in the deep
you had my heart inside of your hand
but you played it with a beating

throw your soul through every open door woah
count your blessings to find what you look for woah
turn my sorrow into treasured gold woah
you'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow woah
you're gonna wish you never had met me
we could have had it all
tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
we could have had it all
you're gonna wish you never had met me
it all it all it all
tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep

we could have had it all
you're gonna wish you never had met me
rolling in the deep
tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
you had my heart inside of your hand
you're gonna wish you never had met me
and you played it to the beat
tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep

we could have had it all
you're gonna wish you never had met me
rolling in the deep
tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
you had my heart inside of your hand
you're gonna wish you never had met me

but you played it
you played it
you played it
you played it to the beat"
Adele,Set Fire to the Rain,0.3,2,80,"i let it fall my heart
and as it fell you rose to claim it
it was dark and i was over
until you kissed my lips and you saved me
my hands they were strong
but my knees were far too weak
to stand in your arms
without falling to your feet
but there's a side to you
that i never knew never knew
all the things you'd say
they were never true never true
and the games you'd play
you would always win always win
but i set fire to the rain
watched it pour as i touched your face
well it burned while i cried
'cause i heard it screaming out your name
your name
when i lay with you
i could stay there
close my eyes
feel you here forever
you and me together nothing is better
'cause there's a side to you
that i never knew never knew
all the things you'd say
they were never true never true
and the games you'd play
you would always win always win
but i set fire to the rain
watched it pour as i touched your face
fire falls from the sky crying in the rain calm tears 
goodbye to love feeling so cold
well it burned while i cried
'cause i heard it screaming out your name
your name
i set fire to the rain
and i threw us into the flames
when it fell something died
'cause i knew that that was
the last time the last time
sometimes i wake up by the door
that heart you caught must be waiting for you
even now when we're already over
i can't help myself from looking for you
i set fire to the rain
watched it pour as i touched your face
well it burned while i cried
'cause i heard it screaming out your name
your name
i set fire to the rain
and i threw us into the flames
when it fell something died
'cause i knew that that was the last time
the last time
oh oh no
let it burn

i heard you've been missing me
you've been telling people things you shouldn't be
like when we creep out when she ain't around
whispers in the dark love falls apart heart is 
lonely goodbye darling missing you
haven't you heard the rumours
bless your soul you've got your head in the clouds
